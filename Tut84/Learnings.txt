What i learnt after watching soln vdo:

1)Was unable to change svg color using CSS
>As the SVGs are by default black, use "filter: invert(1);" 

2)Was unable to implement responsive height for ".library-actions" & ".sidebar" as a whole
>

3)Was unable to make the "play-btn" animation when hovered  over "song-card"
>
