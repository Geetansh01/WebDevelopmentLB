<!--
    Mistakes realised after watching soln video (Tut 47):
    1)I burnt through the entire JS code adding elements using functions like "document.createElement("div");" and even giving them styles using JS functions to add inline CSS like "thumbnail.style.borderRadius = "12px";" ðŸ”¥ðŸ”¥

    2)While the above approach worked just fine, it was more time consuming and effort taking, instead what cwh did was 1st make the card normally using HTML & CSS. When the card looked fine, he copied the HTML and used the JS property "element.innerHTML" to add that HTML dynamically using JS. 

    3)cwh's approach was easier and also, inline CSS was not added as the styles remained in the <style> tag!
